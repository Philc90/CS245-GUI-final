CS 245 Final Project Summer 2016
By Philip Chiang and George Tong
Course taught by Professor Tony Diaz

The final project for CS 245 - Programming Graphical User Interfaces is a group of minigames. The program starts in a menu which has options to start the game, view high scores, or view credits. Starting the game takes the player through 3 minigames: Hangman, Color/Word match, and Sudoku. At the end of the program the player is invited to enter their initials if they make it to the high scores list. It is programmed in Java Swing.
